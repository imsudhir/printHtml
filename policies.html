                    and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association
                    (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (“Commercial Rules”) in effect at that time. The Rules
                    are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement you can
                    find them <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Commercial%20Rules.pdf">here</a> or by calling
                    the AAA at 1–800–778–7879. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Agreement.&nbsp; The arbitration
                    shall be administered by the AAA and shall be conducted by a sole arbitrator selected in accordance with the
                    Commercial Rules unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.&nbsp; Unless Printful and you agree
                    otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in Charlotte, North Carolina, except that, for Users,
                    any arbitration hearings will take place in the county of your residence.&nbsp; Judgment on any arbitration
                    award may be entered and enforced by any court that has jurisdiction to do so. Any arbitration will take
                    place on an individual basis and neither the arbitrator nor AAA are empowered to conduct a class
                    arbitration, class action or to resolve claims of more than a single claimant in anything other than a
                    single proceeding, unless both parties consent. You and Printful acknowledge that AAA may conclude that the
                    Consumer Arbitration Rules or the Rules for the International Centre for Dispute Resolution may be more
                    appropriate in certain cases. You and Printful agree to abide by the decision of the AAA as to the
                    applicable rules in cases where a party may assert that the Commercial Rules are not appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
